### Setup
Both players have 11 bugs:

Queen Bee, 2 Spiders, 2 Beetles, 3 Grasshoppers, 3 Ants

### Beginning
One player places a piece on the field, the next player places one of their pieces next to it.


### Game

#### Placing
You can always add a new piece. However, with expition of the first piece by each player, pieces may not be placed next to a piece of the other color.

#### Moving
After having placed your own queen Bee, you can move a piece of your self instead of adding a new one. How you can move the piece depens of the creature.
